long-title: "Probing Hidden Spin Order with Interpretable Machine Learning"
abstract: "Machine learning shows promise for improving our understanding of many-body problems. Tackling an unsolved problem, or classifying intricate phases, remains however a daunting task. Building on a recently introduced interpretable supervised learning scheme, we introduce a generic protocol to probe and identify nonlinear orientational spin order, and extract the analytical form of the tensorial order parameter up to rank 6. Moreover, we find that our approach yields reliable results already for a modest amount of training data and without knowledge of the exact phase boundary. Our approach may prove useful for identifying novel spin order and ruling out spurious spin liquid candidates."

## Supplemental Materials

We elaborate some of the more technical details of our work in the Supplemental
Materials at the end of the ArXiv preprint, in particular:

* the redundancy in the monomial mapping and how we account for it;
* the regularization parameter in SVM and its reformulation, $$\nu$$-SVM in terms
  of a more controlled regularization parameter $$\nu$$ and the influence of its
  choice in the physical problem;
* the decoding of the block structure of the coefficient matrix for the rank-6
  symmetry $$I_h$$.

We also provide [raw data][3] from our simulations of the symmetries covered in
the paper:

* $$T_d$$: full coefficient matrix (TXT + PNG), block structure (TXT + PNG);
* $$O_h$$, $$T_h$$: full coefficient matrix (PNG), block structure (TXT + PNG);
* $$I_h$$: block structure (TXT + PNG), decoded coefficients of order parameter
  tensor.
