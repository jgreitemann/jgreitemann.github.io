I'm a physicist by training and did some research in computational condensed matter physics for my Master's and PhD programs. During that time, I fell in love with C++ and decided to pursue a career in software engineering.

At my current employer, MVTec Software, I'm part of the team developing [_MERLIC_][1], an all-in-one solution for industrial machine vision. My focus is on MERLIC's integration in the automation process on the factory floor. I've worked on MERLIC's compliance with the OPC UA machine vision standard, designed a C API which allows customers to write dedicated communication plug-ins for their particular integration needs, built some plug-ins which are included with MERLIC for common communication protocols such as MQTT, and developed a configuration service based on ZeroMQ to allow remote configuration of both plug-ins and cameras. I've also built up some proficiency in UI programming using Qt/QML.

I'm passionate about writing clean, scalable code which follows the principle of _zero-cost abstraction_, combining the readability and safety of a high-level language with the bare-metal efficiency of a systems language.
I strive to continuously broaden my horizons through attending conferences and meetups, learning and adopting best practices and new language features, always having a toy project on the side to dabble in new tech, and helping out both colleagues and strangers.
