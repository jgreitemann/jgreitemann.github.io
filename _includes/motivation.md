I'm passionate about writing clean, scalable code which follows the principle of _zero-cost abstraction_, combining the readability and safety of a high-level language with the bare-metal efficiency of a systems language.
Until recently, I did so as part of my physics doctorate where I quickly built a reputation among colleagues for my advice in all matters C++.

I strive to continuously broaden my horizons, be it by adopting best practices, trying novel language features (C++20), or learning about emerging tech (Rust, WebAssembly) and agile workflows.
