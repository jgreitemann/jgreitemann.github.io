It's my pleasure to annouce that as of last week, both of the papers we worked on last year have been published in Phys. Rev. B:

{% include svm-papers.html %}

The _Rapid Communication_ was even selected as an Editors' Suggestion, giving it a few days of exposure on PRB's home page:

{% include figure.html

   caption="Screenshot of the PRB home page; Feb 11, 2019" %}

Along with the second paper which investigates the use of multiclassification, we have made the corresponding source codes openly available under the terms of the _GNU General Public License version 3_. An extensive [README file][1] explains how to build, use, and extend our codes to reproduce our findings, or even adapt the framework to your own simulations. (If you intend to do the latter, please feel free to reach out to us, though.)
