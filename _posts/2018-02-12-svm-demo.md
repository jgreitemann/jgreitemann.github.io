### Usage

  * Left- and right-click to add points belonging to either one of two classes to the canvas. Use the "Toogle" button to swap the classes associated with primary and secondary click if right-click is not an option (e.g. on mobile).
  * At least one point in each class is necessary to "learn" an SVM model.
  * Adjust the regularization parameter $$\nu$$ between 0 and 1. Small values correspond to a hard margin, i.e. low tolerance towards misclassified data and may lead to overfitting of noisy data. Large values correspond to a soft margin and may ignore features in the data.
  * Large values of $$\nu$$ that are approaching 1 may cause the SVM optimization to fail.
  * Select a kernel from the drop down menu. The definition of the currently selected kernel is displayed next to the drop down.
  * As far as applicable, alter the parameters $$\gamma$$ and $$c_0$$ that enter the definition of the kernel.
  * For the quadratic kernel, the decision boundary is a conic section.
  * A modern browser is required, capable of executing WebAssembly.
