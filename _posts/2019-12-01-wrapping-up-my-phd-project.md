A new version of the TK-SVM framework has just been released and is now
available on the university's GitLab repository. In keeping with the number of
SVM-related papers we have published in the past 1.5 years, this is version 3
and reflects the changes made to the framework to facilitate our [latest
paper][3], studying the XXZ model on the pyrochlore lattice.

This release brings about a larger selection of sweep policies, more flexibility
in combining data from different runs, a [new client code][4] for generic
classical frustrated spin systems, a new MPI-based parallelization model,
infrastructure for parallel tempering, many extensions to the simple graph
analysis introduced in the previous version, and countless bug fixes. A
comprehensive [changelog][5] is also available.

More information on the TK-SVM method is now also publically available in my
[PhD thesis][2], including an (otherwise unpublished) application to the
Heisenberg model on the Kagome lattice.
This wraps up my involvement with the TK-SVM project, even though this work will
very much continue without me.
