  "description": "An acquisition sequence is part of an image source configuration and defines how the image sources of the respective configuration should be used for the image acquisition in MERLIC. It enables you to set up more complex configurations for the image acquisition including parameter changes, synchronization options, and delays. For example, you may define the acquisition of multiple images from a camera device with different parameter settings and use all of these images in the MVApp in the same iteration.",
